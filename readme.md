This is a hangman game that runs in the terminal. All of the words in the dictionary are bash commands.

Setup - after cloning, navigate to the folder in the terminal and run npm install. This will set up all required packages.

Operation - enter the command "node index.js" in the terminal to begin.
The input uses readline, so press enter after typing your guess or command. It is not case sensitive.

You can quit at any time by typing quit. For the end-of-game dialog, please type the full word yes or no when asked if you would like to play again.
